# Voting Dapp (Decentralized)

Build Blockchain Voting Dapp (Decentralized) using Nextjs, Solidity, MetaMask & Hardhat | Voting App


## Project Overview
###1. Frontend with Next.js and tailwind css
User Interface (UI): Next.js is used for the frontend, providing a responsive interface where users can register, view candidates, and vote. Youâ€™ll create pages for candidate registration, viewing voter lists, casting votes, and viewing results.
MetaMask Integration: Users connect their MetaMask wallet to the DApp for authentication and authorization. MetaMask acts as a gateway for users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
###2. Smart Contract Development with Solidity
Voting Contract: A Solidity smart contract is created to handle voting logic, candidate registration, and eligibility checks. The contract:
Registers Candidates: Allows authorized users to add candidates.
Records Votes: Stores votes on-chain to ensure transparency and immutability.
Ensures Eligibility: Checks voter eligibility to prevent double voting.
Data Storage: The smart contract securely stores the voting data on the blockchain, making it accessible and verifiable.
###3. Blockchain Interaction with Hardhat
Smart Contract Compilation and Deployment: Hardhat is used to compile, deploy, and test the Solidity contract locally on the Hardhat network or a testnet like Sepolia.
Testing and Debugging: Hardhat allows testing the voting contract functions, such as candidate registration, vote casting, and vote counting, before deployment.
###4. Voting and Data Flow
Candidate Registration: Admins register candidates, which get stored on the blockchain. This data is fetched by Next.js to display in the UI.
Casting Votes: Users connect their MetaMask wallet, select a candidate, and cast their vote, which triggers a transaction on the blockchain.
Viewing Results: The app fetches vote counts from the contract, providing real-time results directly from the blockchain.
